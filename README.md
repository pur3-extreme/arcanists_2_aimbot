## CONTROLS
* F1 = set player position on mouse
* F2 = set target position on mouse
* F3 = calculate
* F4 = fire
* F5 = time mode (projectile reaches target after specified time)
* F6 = mousepos mode (trajectory is generated based on cursor angle)
* F7 = minv mode (trajectory is generated with minimized velocity)
* F8 = maxv mode (trajectory is generated with maximized velocity)

## HOW TO USE
* zoom all the way out
* press F1 exactly in the center of your player
* press F2 on the target, then F3
* select a spell then press F4
* if it doesn't fire, the shot is impossible

## OTHER
* untested on resolutions other than 1920x1080
* untested on Linux
* time 1.48 works well for whisper bombs
* F1 needs to be precise, a few pixels off and the trajectory is somewhat messed up
* keeping the camera centered on the character avoids needing to press F1 every time
