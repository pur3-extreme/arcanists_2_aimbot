## IMPORTANT
* This program does not modify game memory/files
* This program does not read game memory/files
* This program does not send inputs via modifying or reading game memory/files
* If you get banned, it's because your gamer skills were too good and the mods couldn't handle your swagger. 
* If you believe this program is being detected by Arcanists, email me immediately. There is likely an easy workaround that I can implement. 

## CONTROLS
* F1 = set player position on mouse
* F2 = set target position on mouse
* F3 = toggle graphing display
* F4 = fire
* F5 = time mode (projectile reaches target after specified time)
* F6 = mousepos mode (trajectory is generated based on cursor angle)
* F7 = minv mode (trajectory is generated with minimized velocity)
* F8 = maxv mode (trajectory is generated with maximized velocity)

## INSTRUCTIONS
* Zoom all the way out
* Press F1 exactly in the center of your player
* Press F2 on your target
* Select your spell
* Let go of mouse
* Press F4

## ADVANCED USE
* mousepos mode (F6) causes the program to use whatever angle your mouse is at when you press F6 (can be held down)
* minv mode (F7) will cause the program to shoot at least possible power required to make the shot
* maxv mode (F8) will cause the program to shoot at greatest possible power required to make the shot
* You can enter values manually in any of the editable fields and the program will use them

## ADDITIONAL NOTES
* tracers won't overlay onto the screen properly unless both the game and the graphing window are maximized
* if the shot is impossible the tracer will turn red
* untested on resolutions other than 1920x1080
* untested on Linux or Unix based systems
* time 1.48 works well for whisper bombs (they solidify at 1.5)
* social distancing + whisper bomb is a good combo
* 1.1 seconds works well for mega boulder
* F1 needs to be precise, a few pixels off and the trajectory is somewhat messed up
* keeping the camera centered on the character avoids needing to press F1 every time
* making high velocity shots at a close range is known to result in relatively large error. I know how to fix it but it requires solving some ugly math stuff so it probably won't be implemented for a while. If anyone likes analytically solving ugly physics equations then email me. 

## FAQ
"My aim is off" - zoom all the way out, make sure your user position is precise. You can get your user position once in sandbox and then manually enter it in the next time you launch the program. As long as your camera is centered on your character (pressing C usually works unless you're at the edge of the map)

"How do I get my user position?" - Press F1 in the VERY center of your character.
