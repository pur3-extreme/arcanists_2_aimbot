Aimbot for Arcanists 2


CONTROLS
F1 = set player position on mouse
F2 = set target position on mouse
F3 = calculate
F4 = fire

HOW TO USE
* resolution must be 1920x1080
* zoom all the way out
* press F1 exactly in the center of your player
* press F2 on the target, then F3
* select a spell then press F4
* if it doesn't fire, the shot is impossible

OTHER
* time 1.48 works well for whisper bombs
* F1 needs to be precise, a few pixels off and the trajectory is fucked up a bit
* keeping the camera centered on the character avoids needing to press F1 every time
